        My experience in life was Computer Science that I took in Freshman year and I was with a friend trying new codes but we didnt get far because we only got so far. My teacher wouldnt help us so we had to look the codes ourself and we made our own personal
        website and I got a A on my assignment. But my goals in life is to be a youtuber as well as be a game designer and be learn how to make music. My accomplishments were perfect attendance at school and in certain cases I get the grit award in certain
        classes. I saw my cousin make a computer and took him days to complete it 
        and I was shocked because I didnt think it would work but it did. I wanted to 
        Computer Science and Game Design because I wanted to learn how to code Games and also 
        to get a feel for making websites for huge companies. Also to have a youtube channel
        for fun and record all my favorite games and hang with my friends.
