    </header>
   <p>
      My experience in life was Computer Science that I took in 
      Freshman year and I was with a friend trying new codes but we 
      didnt get far because we only got so far. My teacher wouldnt help us so 
      we had to look the codes ourself and we made our own personal website 
      and I got a A on my assignment. But my goals in life is to be a youtuber
      as well as be a game designer and be learn how to make music. My 
      accomplishments were perfect attendance at school and in certain cases I 
      get the grit award in certain classes.
