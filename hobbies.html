    <p>My Hobbies are playing games and also I like to learn how to use youtube so I can record my video of my favorite games. As well as I want to be a game designer so I'm looking on what to be doing to be successful. My other hobbies is Soccer and Kickball
        I have the best kick in my class and I have a great passes in Soccer. I also watch stick fights because it's amazing and I used to draw stick fights all time and want to learn how to animate them so they can move around.
