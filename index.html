        <h1>About Jeremy</h1>
    </header>

    <p>I am Jeremy Washington and I like to learn about multiple things to better upgrade my future. I go to a school by the name of University of Chicago Woodlawn Charter also known as UCW. I am a Junior now I passed all my classes last year with A's, B's,and
        one C in chemistry because it was a hard understanding for me during the year. But this year I want to not slack off and do my work the right way so I can go to a really good school and get the best education I need to go to college I want to
        go to. Personally I need help in certain areas because some subjects be confusing and the teacher goes too fast and then when I get home I try to go my computer to try to get a understanding and better confidence for quizzes I need to take. I
        am better organizing my homework and classwork from my binders because I am very unorganized sometimes with my big bookbag so I try to get help with my teachers and my parents so I strive strong. My Family is cool I always get to have fun with
        them and celebrate birthdays with since my life when I was little it was bad but now I have a relationship with my parents and now I am happy. I'm also a angel because I help people out with their work for school.</p>
